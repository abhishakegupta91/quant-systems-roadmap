# Contributing

Thanks for taking the time to contribute.

## What to contribute

- Fix typos, broken links, formatting issues
- Suggest improvements to sequencing, prerequisites, or time estimates
- Add optional resources (prefer official docs and primary sources)

## What not to contribute

- Do not include proprietary content (paid course text, copyrighted PDFs, broker docs that prohibit redistribution)
- Do not include secrets (API keys, account IDs, session cookies)

## How to contribute

- Open an issue first for non-trivial changes.
- For small changes, a direct pull request is fine.
- Keep edits minimal and focused.

## Style

- Use Markdown headings consistently.
- Use relative links for files in this repo.
- Prefer linking to official sources over copying large excerpts.
